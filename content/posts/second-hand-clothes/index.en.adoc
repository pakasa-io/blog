In Uganda, fashion doesn’t have to come with a big price tag, and it certainly doesn’t have to be brand new. From the busy stalls of Owino Market to roadside vendors in every town, mivumba (second-hand clothes) have become a trusted wardrobe staple for millions. Whether it’s a stylish blazer from Europe, a vintage tee from America, or designer jeans at a bargain, Ugandans wear their mivumba with confidence and pride. But beyond just clothing, the second-hand trade is a story of survival, creativity, and culture woven into the fabric of everyday life.

Mivumba is a Luganda term meaning “used clothes”. It became popular in Uganda in the late 1980s and 1990s, after being imported mostly from Europe and North America. These clothes, originally donations or unwanted items abroad, found a new life in Africa. Today, markets like St. Balikuddembe (commonly known as Owino), Nakasero, Kalerwe, and Ggaba are known as hotspots for second-hand shopping.

The variety is endless: dresses, shoes, suits, children’s wear, handbags, vintage pieces, sportswear, and more. It’s not just about affordability, mivumba is a chance to express personal style, mix trends, and sometimes even score a designer label at the price of a soda.

President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni has expressed a desire to ban second-hand clothing imports from Uganda to promote local textile production and industrialization. The government views the ban as a means to stimulate the local economy, create jobs, and encourage the growth of Uganda’s nascent fashion and textile industries. link:https://bnmlaw.org/from-mivumba-to-masterpiece-upcycling-ip-and-the-future-of-fashion-in-uganda/[bnmlaw.org]

However, producing clothing from scratch in Uganda is fraught with challenges, including high production costs, inadequate infrastructure, limited access to quality raw materials, and a lack of skilled labor. These challenges make locally produced garments more expensive than imported second-hand clothing, further complicating efforts to promote local manufacturing.

*Why Ugandans Love Mivumba?*

* *Affordability:* Mivumba is significantly cheaper than new clothing, with second-hand clothes costing as little as sh500, making them a practical choice for low-income earners and students. link:https://allafrica.com/stories/200706040785.html[allafrica.com]

* *Cultural Integration:* Ugandans have integrated mivumba into their culture, viewing it as fashionable, durable, and a symbol of style, rather than just discarded items. link:https://www.scribd.com/document/216696155/Mivumba-in-Kampala-Used-clothes-trade[scribd.com]

* *Economic Impact:* The mivumba trade supports thousands of livelihoods, with over 120 importers and thousands of retailers involved in the supply chain.It is also a highly profitable business, with traders reporting average daily profits of 15% to 20%. link:https://www.watchdoguganda.com/op-ed/20230903/159124/george-mubiru-uganda-is-not-ready-to-ban-mivumba-second-hand-clothes.html[watchdouganda]

* *Historical Context:* The trade originated in the 1970s, with clothes initially smuggled into Uganda from Rwanda, and has since evolved into a major part of Uganda's fashion industry

*Culture and Identity.*

Ugandans have made mivumba part of their identity. From students to office workers, pastors to boda boda riders, second-hand fashion is worn across classes and backgrounds. Some even wear mivumba to weddings and high-profile events, tailored and styled to look brand new. It’s no longer just about what’s new — it’s about what looks good and feels right.

Mivumba has also birthed a generation of young fashion designers and stylists who upcycle second-hand clothes into fresh, modern pieces. What once was considered “used” becomes “unique,” turning old garments into trendy outfits with a personal touch.

In conclusion, Uganda wears mivumba with pride not out of necessity alone, but out of choice, creativity, and confidence. Second-hand clothes have become a symbol of resilience, resourcefulness, and fashion freedom. In a world chasing fast fashion, Uganda reminds us that style doesn't have to be new to be beautiful. Sometimes, the best outfits come with a story and mivumba tells many.
