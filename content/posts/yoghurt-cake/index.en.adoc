*INGREDIENTS*

* 1 Cup of plain yoghurt(regular or Greek)

* 1 cup of sugar

* 3 large eggs

* 1/2 Cup of vegetable oil or melted butter

* 1 1/2 Cup of all-purpose flour

* 2 teaspoons of baking powder

* 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda

* 1/4 teaspoon of salt

* Zest of 1 lemon (optional for added flavour)

*PROCEDURE*

* Pre-heat your oven at 360°F or 175°C. Grease and flour an 8-inch round cake pan or line with parchment paper.

* In a large mixing bowl combine the yoghurt and sugar. Whisk until smooth and well combined. Add the egg one at a time beating well after each addition. Stir in the vegetable oil and vanilla extract until fully incorporated.

* In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.

* Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to over mix. If using lemon zest,fold in at this stage.

* Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes,or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

* Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

* For a simple glaze, mix 1 cup powdered sugar with 2-3 tablespoons lemon juice or milk until smooth. Drizzle over the cooled cake. Although this step is optional.

* Serve the yogurt cake plain or with a dusting of powdered sugar. Add fresh berries or a dollop of whipped cream for a delight touch. For a more decadent treat, serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
