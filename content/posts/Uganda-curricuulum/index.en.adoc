The government rolled out the new lower secondary educa­tion curriculum in February 2020 with the aim of creating meeting the learners’ needs especially in regard to skills training and enhancement. The Minister for Education, Hon. Janet Museveni, in her statement to Parliament, said that the need to review the curriculum was overdue since it had not been revisited since the colonial education system was introduced. The Minister revealed that the old curriculum was channelling out graduates with no practical skills to meet the demands in the labour market.

The National Curriculum Development Centre has made adjustments in the teaching sub­jects for the lower sec­ondary, for ex­am­ple, teach­ing sub­jects have been re­duced from 43 to 21. In the new ap­proved cur­ricu­lum, schools will teach 12 sub­jects at Se­nior One and Two, out of which 11 will be com­pul­sory while one will be from an elec­tive menu (op­tional). Stu­dents at lev­els Three and Four will exit with a min­i­mum of eight or a max­i­mum of nine sub­jects with seven of them com­pul­sory.

Con­se­quently, some sub­jects have taken dif­fer­ent forms: Mu­sic has now in­cluded dance and drama to be­come Per­form­ing Arts; Fine Art has been re­designed to in­clude el­e­ments of de­sign and it is now called Art and De­sign; Tech­ni­cal Draw­ing has been integrated with elements of woodwork and metalwork and technology and it is now called Technology and Design; History has been integrated with Political Education; Accounts and Commerce have been integrated in Entrepreneurship education, and History has been integrated with Political Education.

Under the new curriculum, teachers will compile the learners’ achievements under the Formative Assessment in the four-year cycle, find an average score and submit it to the Uganda National Examinations Board to contribute at least 20 per cent in the final national examinations grading. The Chinese language has been added to the menu of foreign languages while Kiswahili, Physical Education and entrepreneurship will be compulsory for all stdents in Senior One and Two.
