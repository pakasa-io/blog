The old curriculum was rolled out in February 2020 with an aim of meeting the learners’ needs especially in regard to skills training and enhancement. This called for the inauguration of a new lower secondary school curriculum which is also termed as “The Competence-based curriculum”.

In this new curriculum, twelve subjects are studied at senior one and two, out of eleven subjects are compulsory while one is from an elective menu (optional). Students at senior three and four will exit with a minimum of eight or a maximum of nine subjects with seven of them compulsory.

Consequently, some subjects have taken different forms: Music has now included dance and drama to become Performing Arts, Fine Art has redesigned to include elements of design and it is now called Technology and Design, History has been integrated with Political Education, Accounts and Commerce have been integrated in Entrepreneurship education. The Chinese language has been added to the menu of foreign languages while Kiswahili, Physical Education and Entrepreneurship are compulsory for all senior One and Two. The textbooks and learning materials used in this curriculum vary and often are developed and approved by National Curriculum Development Center.

Under this curriculum, teachers will compile the learners’ achievements under the Formative Assessment in the four years cycle, find an average score and submit it to the Uganda National Examinations Board to contribute at least 20 per cent in the final national examination grading.

The new curriculum aims at providing to learners in the 21st Century skills which include; Critical thinking, creativity, collaboration or teamwork, communication, Information literacy, ICT, and flexibility. This is obviously good news to the nation however the perturbing question is whether this will be implemented amidst the facility inadequacies in most of the Ugandan schools. For learners to become creative especially in ICT and the natural sciences, there must be necessary equipment such as well-furnished laboratories, effective internet and obviously knowledgeable trainers. These are still lacking in most rural schools in Uganda which limits knowledge for most young people.

*What are the challenges in the new curriculum?*

* Implementing a new curriculum presents several challenges for teachers, including lack of resources, difficulty in finding affordable and suitable materials, and the need to conform to standards set by educational authorities. Additionally, teachers may face long wait times for professional development support from curriculum experts, making it hard to fully understand and implement the new curriculum effectively.

* Teachers also struggle with producing learning materials that are essential for carrying out lessons, and they often lack updated information due to limited resources, professional development opportunities, and time constraints.

* Furthermore, the transition to a new curriculum can be challenging as it requires teachers to adapt to new pedagogical strategies and methods, which they may not be familiar with.

* Educational leaders must address both technical and adaptive challenges to ensure successful curriculum implementation. Technical challenges can be solved through existing solutions, procedures, tools, and expert guidance, while adaptive challenges require collaborative experimentation with new procedures, norms, or beliefs to address problems of practice with unknown solutions.

* Equity issues also arise when less rigorous curriculum is sometimes implemented for students who are believed to lack the ability to handle more challenging expectations.

*How have these challenges been solved?*

* Educational leaders are addressing the challenges of implementing new curricula by adopting both technical and adaptive strategies. Technical challenges, such as determining the quality of curricular materials, can be solved through the application of existing procedures and tools, like alignment rubrics.
However, adaptive challenges, which involve making fundamental shifts in teaching practices to align with new standards, require leaders and stakeholders to collaboratively experiment with new procedures, norms, and beliefs.

* To address these adaptive challenges, districts provide professional development (PD) workshops to expose teachers to the new curricula and ensure they understand how to use the materials effectively.
Additionally, there is a focus on ensuring that the curriculum is accessible to all students, including those with visual impairments or from marginalized communities, and that it can be adapted for an open learning environment.

* Administrative support is crucial for setting classrooms up for success with new curricula, which includes giving teachers sufficient training and time to become familiar with the new materials.
This approach helps prevent frustration and fatigue among teachers, ensuring a smoother transition to the new curriculum.

*What is the grading of the new curriculum?*

* The new curriculum in Uganda uses a competence-based grading system that differs from the traditional percentage-based system. Under this new system, learners are graded on the competence they exhibit in their subjects, rather than just their knowledge.

* In the new curriculum, each class has a different textbook and specific content to be covered at each level. The grading system includes three clusters of scores: 3, 2, and 1. Score 3 is the highest and replaces distinctions, score 2 replaces credits, and score 1 replaces passes and failures.

* The Uganda Certificate of Education (UCE) will account for 80% of the marks, while the remaining 20% will be accumulated through continuous assessment from Senior One through Senior Four.

This continuous assessment is conducted through various means, including formative assessment, which monitors learning and provides feedback.

* For the Uganda Certificate of Education (UCE) exams, UNEB will partially grade current Senior Three students using marks attained through continuous assessment (class work) when they sit for the exams next year.
The final UCE results will be a combination of the continuous assessment (20%) and the final exam (80%).

* In the new competency-based assessment system, there is no ranking of candidates into divisions as in the previous curriculum. Instead, candidates qualify for the UCE certificate if they obtain a competency level grade of D in at least one subject sat for. The overall results show that 350,146 (98.05%) of the candidates who sat qualified for the UCE certificate.

* The new curriculum also includes a focus on practical skills and project work. Students are given an activity of integration at the end of every chapter or topic, and they choose at least two projects from the three chapters covered each term, with guidance from the teacher.

* The new curriculum aims to ensure learners gain knowledge, understanding, skills, values, and a positive attitude for the world of work, making it more learner-centered and focused on real-life application of knowledge and skills.
