Kingship refers to the position or office of a king, often involving the leadership and governance of a kingdom or state.

Buganda Kingship is one of the most prominent and historically significant monarchies in Uganda. The Kingdom of Buganda is located in the central region of Uganda and was one of the most powerful and influential pre-colonial kingdoms in East Africa. The king of Buganda is known as the *Kabaka*, a title that signifies his role as both the political and spiritual leader of the kingdom.

The kingship of Buganda is believed to have originated with the arrival of Kintu, who came to the region from northeast and seized power from the clan heads, crowning himself the head of all clans Ssaabataka.

According to the Kiganda tradition, Kintu is the founder of Buganda and he came from the direction of Mount Elgon around 1314 AD via Bugisu, Budama, Busoga, and finally to the shores of Lake Victoria to present-day Buganda.

He is said to have come with thirteen or fourteen of the present-day clans of Buganda.

The Abalasangeye dynasty came to power through the conquests of Kabaka Kintu, which are estimated to have occurred sometime between 1200 and 1400 AD.

This is the linkage of Buganda kings.
