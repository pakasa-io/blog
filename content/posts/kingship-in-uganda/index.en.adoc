Kingship refers to the position or office of a king, often involving the leadership and governance of a kingdom or state.

Buganda Kingship is one of the most prominent and historically significant monarchies in Uganda. The Kingdom of Buganda is located in the central region of Uganda and was one of the most powerful and influential pre-colonial kingdoms in East Africa. The king of Buganda is known as the *Kabaka*, a title that signifies his role as both the political and spiritual leader of the kingdom.

The kingship of Buganda is believed to have originated with the arrival of Kintu, who came to the region from northeast and seized power from the clan heads, crowning himself the head of all clans Ssaabataka.

According to the Kiganda tradition, Kintu is the founder of Buganda and he came from the direction of Mount Elgon around 1314 AD via Bugisu, Budama, Busoga, and finally to the shores of Lake Victoria to present-day Buganda.

He is said to have come with thirteen or fourteen of the present-day clans of Buganda.

The Abalasangeye dynasty came to power through the conquests of Kabaka Kintu, which are estimated to have occurred sometime between 1200 and 1400 AD.

This is the linkage of Buganda kings.

*What was the role of a king?*

In Buganda, the king, known as the Kabaka, held absolute executive, legislative, judicial, military, and even economic power.
According to Buganda culture, there are two kings: a spiritual king represented by the Royal Drums, and a material king who rules in the physical world.
Upon the birth of a royal prince or princess, the Royal Drums are sounded to inform the subjects of the kingdom of the birth of a new member of the royal family.
Similarly, the Royal Drums are sounded upon the death of a reigning king to officially announce the death of the material king.
According to Buganda culture, a king does not die but gets lost in the forest.

The role of the material king includes performing special cultural rites on the Royal Drums before being declared king of Buganda.
The material king is also involved in the traditional procedures to crown the new material king after the death of a reigning material king, alongside the spiritual king, Juma Katebe.
The spiritual king, Juma Katebe, is involved in the coronation of the new material king and regularly visits the palace tomb of Kabaka Tebandeke to perform special religious ceremonies.

*What is special about the buganda kings?*

The kings of Buganda, known as Kabaka, are special due to the unique dual-king system in Buganda culture. According to Buganda traditions, they are ruled by two kings: one spiritual and one secular. The spiritual king is represented by the Royal Drums, known as Mujaguzo, which always exist, ensuring that Buganda will always have a king. The material, human prince must perform special cultural rites on the Royal Drums before he can be declared king of Buganda.

The spiritual king is named Juma Katebe, who holds the spiritual priesthood and is involved in the traditional procedures to crown the new material king after the death of a reigning material king. The spiritual king regularly visits the palace tomb of Kabaka Tebandeke to perform special religious ceremonies.

Upon the birth of a royal prince or princess, the Royal Drums are sounded to inform the subjects of the kingdom of the birth of a new member of the royal family. Similarly, the Royal Drums are sounded upon the death of a reigning king to officially announce the death of the material king. In Buganda culture, a king does not die but gets lost in the forest.

The firstborn prince is not allowed to become king to protect him from assassination attempts. Instead, he is given special roles in the matters of the royal family and kingdom. The name of the possible successor to the throne remains secret until the death of the reigning king.

The Kabaka has his own clan, called the royal clan "Olulyo Olulangira," and members of this clan are referred to as abalangira for males and abambejja for females. This clan is not matrilineal, despite common misconceptions.
